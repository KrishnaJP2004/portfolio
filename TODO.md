# TODO: Push Images and Files to GitHub Repository

- [ ] Check if Git is initialized in the current directory (c:/Users/ragul/Downloads/final) using `git status`
- [ ] If not initialized, initialize Git repository with `git init`
- [ ] Add the remote repository URL as origin: `git remote add origin https://github.com/KrishnaJP2004/portfolio.git`
- [ ] Add all files to the staging area: `git add .`
- [ ] Commit the files with a message: `git commit -m "Add portfolio images and files"`
- [ ] Push the changes to the main branch: `git push -u origin main`
- [ ] Verify the push was successful and check for any issues (e.g., authentication, branch name)
